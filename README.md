# Sleep-Stage
Sleep stage classification:​
Sleep stage classification involves the segmentation of sleep stages, namely wake, N1, N2, N3, and REM, using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals
## Algorithms
Applying deep learning techniques, specifically classification algorithms, to improve the existing U2-Net algorithms for sleep stage classification​
An attention module composed of ECA attention mechanism and spatial attention mechanism​
